Every pair was sized well (I ordered up to a 2xl, or a 9, from my usual 8), even a little loose on a pair or two. The seller is definitely paying attention to actual, not just listed size.I purchased these mainly because hubby had a sudden desire to see more g's, after a decade of liking other styles. And this order didn't disappoint. I liked 10/11 pairs, and even the last pair was cute, just a little bright for me. There's a pair of really lovely black lace g's, a couple of matching lace thongs (different colors, same panties), an adorable see-through pair of white with black butterflies, and several other cute lacey pairs.I will absolutely order this pack again, maybe even trying different styles.Thanks to the seller for the great variety and fit!"

With the hopes that this will help someone else: according to the size chart posted, I *should* have ordered an extra large. To me, that felt silly becuase I would normally go straight for a medium. I took a chance and purchased the large, which is only supposed to fit up to a 27 inch waist (very skewed, but ok). My hip circumference is 39 inches around the biggest part of my butt, and the size large are super comfortable- they fit perfectly without stretching at all. I probably could have ordered the medium and been fine since these do stretch, but I have experienced no rolling or falling down or anything so I am happy. I was also worried that the lace back would show up under some of my work pants, but that is not the case at all. Even with body hugging outfits you can't see these, plus they're cute and I really liked the color variety. This is a steal compared to the 20-30 dollar a pair underwear you see in department stores (btw, when the heck did undies get so dang expensive?). Overall I am very happy, but I do think the size chart should be updated to make the sizing less confusing."

If you follow the manufacturer’s sizing chart, (not Amazon’s) then you will be pleasantly surprised. I ordered manufacturer’s size M which is equivalent to a US size S. Your waistline for this size should be between 22.0 - 27.5 in. For reference, I’m a size 2 with narrow hips and a very small booty. As far as looks, I dislike full bottom panties but these are really pretty and I don’t feel like I have a bunch of fabric getting ready to target and hike up in to my crack.I took off one star because while the back of these lacy beauty’s are completely seamless under clothes (if you get the right size), the front is a different situation. The fabric is thick and double-lined with reverse stitching. So, the seams are sewn on the inside which creates an unflattering, bulky outline through fitted clothes. That makes the whole point of these ‘seamless’ panties counter productive.Overall, I don’t regret this purchase and these panties will work just fine under flowy dresses/skirts and loose fitting pants.

They are soft and appeared to be made ok (not cheaply made, but not well made either). The sizing is way off, but I thankfully read previous reviews and decided to take heed of their warnings.  I am 5' 6.5"", 130 pounds, wear size 4 pants, but have a little 'junk in the trunk' in terms of body shape.  Usually, I wear a size small underwear, or maybe an occasional medium, depending on the brand.  I ordered an xlarge and they fit perfectly - which is quite shocking.  So, my advice is order about 2 sizes bigger than you normally would."

They lay perfectly flat and feel good. I read somewhere that some people found the lace too scratchy, but I honestly don't. Its not as fine as some other panties I have, but it's comfortable and smooth. The colors are really vibrant. One tip: cut all the size-tags out immediately, they're made from the worst, scratchy, paper tag material and they're huge and visible otherwise. Other than that, these are a good deal!"

I received 21 as well as some other reviewers did.I ordered small.. I’m 5ft and about 110lbs if that helps any.I guess I over looked that it’s a mixed style of thongs to granny panties.. The item and picture describe just thongs, but when you ACTUALLY READ THE READ DESCRIPTION — it clear as day explains what’s included...With that being said there was truly only one panty that was TOO FREAKING HUGE.It was the peach one I labeled as size comparison in the photos. Like ?? Why’s the crotch so freaking long... must be what one of the reviewers were talking about. I mean I’d literally have to wear this thing at my belly button if not higher — it just isn’t logical.The lavender g string on top of the peach panties are from Walmart — because I actually once purchased them 😂 so that was weird to see in this purchase.Also a couple are from target. The exhilaration tag were still on a few of them. It’s like they cut off just the letter size but not always the entire label off. I don’t get it.Thankfully I only got two granny panties and shockingly enough they both fit 😂 but I have no intention of wearing them... like ever.There’s like some bikini/boy short/cheeky (whatever style it’s called) assorted in the lot as well. They’re okay. They fit well. It’s just they look big when you compare them to a skimpy thong but they’ll be fine. I just don’t think I’ll wear them either because they’ll literally just go up my butt anyway and who really wants to be picking that out — not I, Bahah.Also I saw some people saying how their thongs got ripped or whatever from the tags being cut too close to the stitching or pulled out of the seams  ... I didn’t have any issues like that thankfully.Over all I’d buy again. I did not notice a chemical/dye odor either.I just wish I had more colored thongs/g strings like everyone else.I feel like I got the last of the ugly... like everyone got the cute thongs and I just got the crappy left overs before their new shipment came in or however they acquire their panties. My luck.Hope this review helped you!"

I got only 1 truly atrocious pair, most are thongs - even the bikinis are still “cute” underwear and not “period panties”, there was no smell (another review mentioned one), and only one pair started to fray in the wash (my first stop, after opening of course). For $1.25/pair this deal can’t be beat. Sure it’ll be luck of the draw as to whether you get things that are your style, but hey, if you’re gonna start to be brave about colors and patterns, where better to start that an article of clothing that isn’t publicly seen?

These guys hit all of my underwear requirements right on the head!  I have been searching for the perfect thongs for a while now and I feel like my search is over with these.  I was wearing the cotton thongs with lace waist prior and although they are great at not marking under clothes, the lace falls apart way too fast in the wash and I don't find them to be nearly as comfortable as these.  I will also mention that I have only washed these once so far so I cannot comment on the longevity just yet but I think they'll hold up way better than the lace ones.A few things:1. Two were repeats.  I don't care about this and neither does the hubs.2. They do have tags on the back and I wish they didn't.  The tags have to be cut off as opposed to being able to remove them completely by un-sewing them.  This is the only negative for me.3. Some are softer than others but they're all still very comfortable.4. The cotton crotch lining piece is bigger than in any of my other thongs which I really like.  It comes up higher in the front.5. They are snug and stay perfectly in place without creating any tightness in the waist.  I practically don't even feel them.6. They come in patterns which makes them cuter than the all plain colored ones usually available in cotton.I hope this review helps someone else since I know how difficult it can be to find perfect underwear.  I love these so much I am about to order my second pack because I'm worried they'll either stop selling them or they'll alter how they're made somehow.Update 8/9/18 - attaching a picture of packs two and three I just received.  They came in the exact same patterns as the first pack and the two repeats are also the same (plain beige and purple pattern).  I will note the price went up a bit - I paid $19.86 for the first pack and $21.17 for the other two packs.  I love these so much I don't want to wear any of my other underwear anymore.  Also, I have now washed and dried the first pack a few times and they still look brand new."

I have bought other cheap packs of thongs on Amazon which fall apart quickly.  But these look very well stitched, and the cotton is not too thin.  I received a few duplicate patterns, but that doesn't bother me, since I still have about 9 different patterns to choose from out of 12.  Can't complain.Update:  after several months of wearing and washing, these thongs have proven themselves extremely comfortable and durable.

They're not for a sexy date night but at the same time they're cute enough that I would have no problems with a date seeing me in these. They're really comfortable but I wouldn't say they are completely no show as the cotton band that goes around your hips is wide and tends to roll up when you sit down (or at least on me). Maybe if I went a size down this wouldn't happen as it'd be a little tighter around the hip but again not really an issue under most clothes.Yes you get duplicates in the pack but I'm pretty sure these are just in a huge bin and 12 are counted out at random. Again, to me, this is really no big deal. I mean come on you're wearing them under your clothes and for the money I don't really think anyone has room to complain about this.These also hold up very well when run through the washer AND dryer!! I usually air dry thongs but, living in a studio, my place started to look absolutely insane on laundry day with clothes drying everywhere. So lazy me just tosses these in the dryer and if there is any shrinkage its very minimal. I've only had 1 pair tear at the side seams but that was actually due to the washing machine and me rushing while pulling the clothes out.I've purchased this pack twice now and as long as the price stays similar, I will continue to when needed."

It only took about 8 years, but I'm now back to feeling bliss again in my cotton undies.  I guess I can officially throw away the 10-year old V. Secret undies I've been hoarding since they changed their style to one that only 6-year old girls can wear.  My husband thanks you for that.  These undies are incredibly comfy and WILL NOT RIDE UP.  I am 44 and wear a size 6/8 with a real booty, and the medium fits great.  The elastic doesn't feel like it's even there, but believe me it works. Yes, they show a panty line.  If anyone tells you they don't, then they are either lying or are wearing very baggy pants.  I don't wear them under tight pants - thats what thongs are for.  I do, however, put them on immediately after coming home from work and when I'm wearing looser clothing.  They're also a dream to sleep in.  They get softer as you wash them.  I've bought every package of these that Amazon offers and was tickled pink to see they finally added a pack of only black.  My only negative is the look (which luckily just doesn't matter so much to me since I'm not an underwear model.)  To me, they are a cross between bikinis and lower briefs.  The band on the side is much wider than typical bikinis, but I'm guessing that might be why the fit across the butt is perfect.  My pictures are of one pair of washed undies so you see what they look like in real life.  So, Amazon....please don't go changing things.  Don't put spandex in and cut the back so they look like bad thongs that real women can't wear.  Please keep them just the way they are and make a million more colors.  I will continue to buy them and hoard them like the 80s.  Bye Bye, Vic's Secret.  I'm too old for you."

I'm a mom and I've discovered I prefer comfort over style so cotton bikinis suit me really well! I saw these underwear and I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical because I wondered if they would be good quality or not. I have some items from the Amazon Basics line and like them so I figured I'd give these a try.The Amazon Essentials Cotton Bikini underwear come in a six-pack and you can currently choose from two styles: basic assorted and fashion assorted. The basic assorted package comes with the following colors: two white, one light pink, one light purple, one black, and one black and white stripe. The fashion assorted package contains: one salmon color, one navy, one navy and white stripe, one light purple, one white with black polka dots, and one white with black flowers. These underwear are made of 95% cotton and 5% elastane. You can machine wash in warm water and tumble dry low. These are made in Sri Lanka.I initially ordered the basic assorted package and liked them enough that I immediately ordered the fashion assorted package as well. The underwear are very soft and comfortable! I really like the variety of colors and I would buy more if they decided to provide more colors. I've washed these underwear several times now according to the instructions and I didn't notice any shrinking. The stitching looks like good quality and I love that they don't ride up, which means these will work nicely when I exercise! I usually wear yoga pants and notice slight panty lines but they are hardly noticeable if you aren't looking for them. The bikini style sits comfortably at my hip and the band at the waist measures 2 3/8 inches. For size reference, I am 5'6"", 165 pounds with a bit of a belly after having my twins and I purchased the large size which fit perfectly. I generally wear a 10 or 12 in pants and am glad I purchased the large.I am happy I found these because they are incredibly comfortable. When I wear them, I actually hardly notice I'm wearing them because they are so light and comfortable! If Amazon decided to make more of these in different colors, I will definitely buy those as well. If you are looking for a good-quality, inexpensive and comfortable option to very expensive underwear, these are it! If these don't last as long as I'd like, I will update this review. Until then, I recommend these underwear because they are some of the most comfortable underwear I've owned and they don't cost an arm and a leg!"

If you need to walk around during exercises, keep the clothing covering light or the bluetooth will disconnect at the worst time possible. While the product is discreet and mostly quiet, I'm assuming you will draw attention to yourself if used in public. The higher settings are not as quiet. Plus I've found it easier to say ""I don't know"" because it's hard to explain to your kids where that weird noise is coming from.

Over the years, I tried a couple of other Kegel products and gave up. I think I needed more of a “beginner” option, and this has that. It is the first one I can see myself using consistently and making improvements with. I prefer the assessment mode and the self-programmed mode (manual training in the app) as well the mode without the app. I have weak muscles and those modes have more feedback that allows me to see what/how I am doing. I was able to use this right away, but I knew I wasn’t quite using it optimally in a couple of ways. The in-app information and email support were incredibly helpful. They went above and beyond to make sure I had more than enough information to start to succeed. As a result of their help and this innovative product, I already am seeing improvements. :) (small steps, but progress)Prior to writing this review, I wrote support to ask about a couple of less expensive, similar looking products I saw on Amazon. They proudly explained the differences, which include the others not offering their top-notch, medical profession support but also  materials quality and hygienic design aspects that aren’t obvious in the photos. As a result, I feel even more confident recommending this particular item."

The app helps to gives a visual gauge of the contraction; I didn't realize how weak my pelvic floor muscles were!  Although I have more work to do, within a week, my sacrum is remaining more stable and my back pain has subsided. I am definitely going to keep at it.

You get the illusion of wearing a much skimpier style of panties without the discomfort. The material is soft and feels nice against the skin. The cut of the panties and the elasticated lace lays smoothly around the thighs and across the waist.  I think these might have just jumped into top spot in both alluring and comfortable.

I did recieve two of the same package - light pink, pink and white stripes, black, grey, white (with black lace). They did well in the first wash and I haven't had any issues with them falling apart like in some other reviews. I'm pretty happy so far and will buy more when needed."

That's the only reason I didn't return them. They're soft, which just the right amount of stretch to stay in place without constricting.However, as other reviewers have said, the colors probably won't be as varied as the pictures show. I got three sets of the same very bland design or solid, almost neutral colors. Add in the fact that it does not fit like it looks on the model (check the fit description photo for how it actually looks on, much closer to ""granny panties""), and I feel like I could have gotten better looking panties for cheap at Walmart or target.Again, though, these are ridiculously comfortable, so it depends what you're looking for. Get them for comfort, not for cute, and be pleasantly surprised if you get more colors."

I have done a ton of walking, working, working out, everything and these undies stay exactly where they're supposed to. They are lower rise/hipster, which is exactly what I want and love. I have one pair or super low rise pants and the lace top of the undies pokes out, so I'll either wear different undies or a longer shirt.

Not all styles/colors are the same material.,"April 19, 2018",Size: X-Large,Color: Black/Flamingo Pink/Miami Pink Octagon,"My husband and I share this account, so ignore the name. For the sake of the review I felt it was important to clarify that I am a woman.I purchased two packs of these in different colors. First, it's important to note that these are not all the same material. One pack I received was polyester and the other was cotton. I thought I was receiving polyester per the description. I just went back to check the listing to make sure I didn't miss anything and apparently I did. If you select a different style/color, the description of the underwear does NOT change until you ALSO select a size. This was an oversight on my part but was also a bit misleading. I like to be pretty active and I'm not a fan of how cotton underwear tends to stretch and get baggy throughout the day so I returned the cotton ones. The polyester ones are a cheaper itchier material than what I am used to. Especially for the brand. Not bad. Just OK. The size was also smaller than I expected. I usually wear an XL and have even lost 10lbs recently but these are a bit tight. Still wearable but if I were to order again, I would definitely go up a size without fear of them being too big. Overall, if you are looking for OK, basic underwear, go for it.  If you were looking for something a bit nicer, I'd look elsewhere."

I am 5'3 and 140 and they are true to size and very consistent. Sometime you see quality go down with brands over time but these remain tried and true. These give great lift and build beautiful and full cleavage. The plunging center makes it perfect to wear with a lower but shirt with out your bra being in sight. This is a 2 hook bra,but has a wider band that does not roll together or bunch. I have had no issues with the underwire breaking through ever. I will confess that I do machine wash these and put them in the dryer which causes the jewel in the center to fall off but that is my fault. Even with the machine washing they never lose their shape.

This bra looks absolutely beautiful and washed well in the washer on gentle cycle in a lingerie bag. I turned the bra inside out also so that the lace was on the inside instead. {There were other clothes also in the washer at the same time}. The bra is really pretty and seems well made.The cup size is a bit large even though it is padded. I wore it and spent the entire day adjusting the straps and trying to get the bra band to stay down. So, the band could have been too large {I lost 5 pounds between buying it and wearing it}, but the sides cut into me and I would not order a smaller size because of that. This is truly the most uncomfortable bra that I have ever worn.It was very annoying in so many ways. The lace is very scratchy even though it was washed before wearing. The side wires really dig in, but the cups were larger than expected.The bra rode up constantly and just didn't fit or feel right. It is like it stretched from the time I put it on until I took it off. Weird.It is an adorable bra and if it didn't have those issues would be a 4 or 5 star bra for how well it is made. As it is though... three stars as I really hate it, but added a star for it being well made and  I also love all the different colors that this bra comes in.  Sad that it didn't work out because of the fit and it being so uncomfortable and scratchy. I would not recommend this bra. I purchased the hot pink one also and it is getting returned."

Highly recommend, especially for those that need a seemless fit not only in the sides but on the underside as well. Some mentioned these feeling flimsy and poorly made with poor quality material.

Once I’ve worn them for the event I’m going to, I’ll update:*Surprisingly cute. Husband Man approves and appreciates, as do I. The stretch lace cheeks are comfy and pretty.*Tough but not too tight feeling waist band and sturdy stitching.  The material definitely holds and smooths, I don’t think the waist band will roll or slide down any.*There was some butt liftage. Nothing crazy, but things look perkier in the derrière area.*Material is warm, but breathes.Now, I’m not sure if I would call these negatives, but they might cause a love/hate relationship:*I’m not sure if I should have gone up a size or not, but the back rolls are out in their full glory. Tummy - nice and smooth, no muffin top. Back - oh dear lord. I may have to wear a smoothing cami in addition to these. I feel like they could have gone higher up 2 or 3 inches. I don’t think if I had gone a size up it would have mattered or I wouldn’t have had the same perfect-for-me tummy control.*The leg holes are aaaaaaalmost too tight. Not uncomfortable, but I think I would have to wear these for a little while before I wasn’t constantly aware of the leg of these in the inner thigh crease.*Be aware that the lace has a ‘nude’ lining. I didn’t even notice at first because it matches my skin tone very well. Just don’t want anyone to be shocked that their behind is suddenly a different hue.UPDATE: added a fourth star: I ended up wearing these yesterday at work to make sure they were going to do their job at the wedding I’m attending. I wore them with a smoothing cami for about 11 hours.  There was absolutely NO sliding or rolling down.  My cami wanted to scrunch up when worn over the panty, so I ended up tucking the cami into the panty and everything stayed in place. For the first few hours, the legs were a little uncomfortable (I sit at a desk all day), but they did eventually stretch out a bit.All day and I didn’t feel overheated, I didn’t feel overly squished.  I’m thoroughly happy with this shape wear and have already ordered more from this company!>>> I am 5’5” and 235 lbs.

I know that pant sizes and all that jazz are funky wherever you go (perks of buying women's clothes... NOT), so I'm going to tell you that I'm a size 10/12 (I fluctuate depending on time-of-the-month) in American Eagle ""Denim X"" super-stretch, high-waisted jeans. I've bought shapewear before that was too big, which doesn't help anybody, so I figured I'd buy a size or two smaller than what the size chart said. Apparently, I should be a 3XL, but I ended up buying an XL and it fit well! A little right, sure, but I wanted it that way to help keep everything ""locked and loaded."" What I love about this shaper is that it's super cute! I mean, it's not like anyone was going to see it anyway, but I felt pretty wearing it. Most shapers are ugly with no flare or anything to it. This shaper has a more lingerie-type look, which honestly helped to boost my confidence. I still wear this shaper whenever I wear dresses. Definitely give it a try, but be sure to consider how ""tightly packed"" you want to feel in it. Again, remember that I wanted mine tight, so I bought 2 sizes smaller than what size the chart says I should have. If that's not your thing, I'd go for 1 size smaller than recommended for a more relaxed fit that'll still hold you together. I feel like buying ""true"" size wouldn't help, but that's just me.

The quality was consistent. I ordered another in a different color. I love this product. I already have a butt so I don't need anything to make it bigger. It doesn't make it bigger but it gives it a shape that I love. I was walking today and kept looking at my butt because I love the way it looks with it on. My husband thinks it is regular underwear because that's what it looks like. It doesn't have the shapewear look or feel which initially scared me but let me assure you, I have going to Macy's for 13 years consistently buying a particular brand of shapewear while it gave me the same shape as this one, this one is far more comfortable. I was paying $60 a piece. I can't stress enough how much I really love it. I am an average consumer. I didn't get anything from this company for a review. I just wanted to share with other women who may want something to hide a bulge or shape a butt. I finally found out that shapewear doesn't have to squeeze the breath out of me or give me abrasions to look good. It's not expensive enough to feel like you wasted your money if you don't like it but I think you will love it."

Appealing in its simplicity the undergarment is finished with delicate 1/4 inch hems at the leg holes and waistline.Fabric care is reasonably non-fussy. Machine wash warm with like colors on delicate cycle and tumble dry low heat. No iron or bleach. I am usually between a medium and large but because of the cotton content I went up a size in the event of significant shrinkage but that was not necessary.After laundering, they looked as good as when I put them in the wash and shrinkage was minimal with 3/8 inch in length and 1/4 inch in height. Sizing is correct and since shrinkage is not an issue, next time I would select my usual size.The basic assortment is made up of neutral colors and includes black and white horizontal stripe, black, grey, beige and two pairs of white. Very compact, so besides usual daily use they would be excellent to pack when traveling. If necessary, they could be hand washed easily drying overnight.

Took off one star because while the fabric is soft and comfortable it is a bit on the thin size, which honestly isn't unexpected. Might order these in the basic colors too if the multi print pack holds up over the next few months. I will say, the blue stripey ones are a little on the cheap looking side, but the rest are cute.

My first impression was that, although they are soft, they don't feel like cotton at all.  They're much stretchier.  That's not necessarily a down side, and they're quite comfortable to wear without riding up.  However, if you wear them with pantiliners, pads, etc., the adhesive will NOT stick to this fabric.  The crotch area is the same slick, stretchy fabric as the rest of the panty.  For that reason, I wouldn't purchase them again, but I'll continue to wear this set.  One other small issue is that the ""tagless"" label in the back is bulky enough that you can feel it on the outside.

Often when I buy high leg briefs, they either fit too high or too low on the waist, or too large in the rear. I no longer even try to buy Hanes, Fruit of the Loom, or any other multi-pack undies typically found in stores, because the fit is always terrible. I thought I was doomed to buy overpriced Victoria's Secret briefs forever, since they are some of the only ones I've ever found that fit me properly. I feel like I am neither short or long waisted, so I don't understand why there are so many fit issues with what should be basic undies. These fit perfectly, though! They reach just underneath my belly button, so I wouldn't call them granny panties, but they aren't bikinis, either. These are how high leg briefs should always fit, in much opinion. I didn't notice any shrinkage at all when washed in cold water and dried on low heat. They are holding up very well so far and appear to be very good quality. No issues with wedgies or sliding around, either. Very comfortable!I wear a size 14 in pants, and ordered size XL. I'm sure they could also fit a size 16, as I'm currently 4 months pregnant and they still fit great."

That said, they ended up being really cute, and relatively comfortable. As per other reviews, I did order up a size. I normally wear a small, but I ordered a medium. They actually fit really well.

Not 100% as pictured, not the worst but could be better.","July 21, 2019",Size: Medium,,"I bought the mediums and they run true to size. For reference, I'm pear-shaped with a big butt at 34"" around my hip bones and 42"" around the widest part of my butt. That makes me both a medium and a large in US sizes at the same time, so I never know which to buy. Since a thong usually goes ::ahem:: inbetwixt the cheeks, I usually go with the smaller size which worked out well in this case. My weight and size also tend to yoyo a lot, but these are so stretchy and breathable that I think they will work well for a variety of weights, sizes, and body types which is a huge plus.If you're on the fence about what size to get, I would suggest ordering the size you normally wear. If you're in between sizes and most of your girth is in your butt, I would go with the smaller size. If you're in between and most of your girth is in your hips and belly, I would go with the larger size.The fabric is listed as 95% cotton and 5% spandex. They are very thin which makes them super breathable and comfortable even on hot days, but because of that the lighter colors are pretty much sheer and I could see these wearing out or developing holes in a pretty short period of time. I don't anticipate them lasting more than a year. But for this price, there are going to be some consessions. They also have a gusset, which I prefer and find more comfortable.The only thing I was really dissapointed about were the colors. I wasn't deterred by the ""random assortment"" because I liked all of the colors pictured. Unfortunately, the colors I received aren't any of the ones pictured. I got 2 packs with 5 pairs in each, both with the same assortment (lame). But the colors are all light pink and coral pastel patterns that I would never have picked and the white trim makes them look like little girls' underoos. They remind me of the packs of Disney panties I would get as a kid. Fine for a tween or teen, but at my age it feels a bit creepy. I'm not going to return them because I need new thongs and the price is right... but I definitely won't be wearing these on date night. That alone is why I won't be repurchasing these."

Size small probably could have fit me, but it possibly could have cut into my sides, creating bulges under clothes, so I went with the medium instead.

These guys hit all of my underwear requirements right on the head!  I have been searching for the perfect thongs for a while now and I feel like my search is over with these.  I was wearing the cotton thongs with lace waist prior and although they are great at not marking under clothes, the lace falls apart way too fast in the wash and I don't find them to be nearly as comfortable as these.  I will also mention that I have only washed these once so far so I cannot comment on the longevity just yet but I think they'll hold up way better than the lace ones.A few things:1. Two were repeats.  I don't care about this and neither does the hubs.2. They do have tags on the back and I wish they didn't.  The tags have to be cut off as opposed to being able to remove them completely by un-sewing them.  This is the only negative for me.3. Some are softer than others but they're all still very comfortable.4. The cotton crotch lining piece is bigger than in any of my other thongs which I really like.  It comes up higher in the front.5. They are snug and stay perfectly in place without creating any tightness in the waist.  I practically don't even feel them.6. They come in patterns which makes them cuter than the all plain colored ones usually available in cotton.I hope this review helps someone else since I know how difficult it can be to find perfect underwear.  I love these so much I am about to order my second pack because I'm worried they'll either stop selling them or they'll alter how they're made somehow.Update 8/9/18 - attaching a picture of packs two and three I just received.  They came in the exact same patterns as the first pack and the two repeats are also the same (plain beige and purple pattern).  I will note the price went up a bit - I paid $19.86 for the first pack and $21.17 for the other two packs.  I love these so much I don't want to wear any of my other underwear anymore.  Also, I have now washed and dried the first pack a few times and they still look brand new."

I received a few duplicate patterns, but that doesn't bother me, since I still have about 9 different patterns to choose from out of 12.  Can't complain.Update:  after several months of wearing and washing, these thongs have proven themselves extremely comfortable and durable.

They're not for a sexy date night but at the same time they're cute enough that I would have no problems with a date seeing me in these. They're really comfortable but I wouldn't say they are completely no show as the cotton band that goes around your hips is wide and tends to roll up when you sit down (or at least on me). Maybe if I went a size down this wouldn't happen as it'd be a little tighter around the hip but again not really an issue under most clothes.Yes you get duplicates in the pack but I'm pretty sure these are just in a huge bin and 12 are counted out at random. Again, to me, this is really no big deal. I mean come on you're wearing them under your clothes and for the money I don't really think anyone has room to complain about this.These also hold up very well when run through the washer AND dryer!! I usually air dry thongs but, living in a studio, my place started to look absolutely insane on laundry day with clothes drying everywhere. So lazy me just tosses these in the dryer and if there is any shrinkage its very minimal. I've only had 1 pair tear at the side seams but that was actually due to the washing machine and me rushing while pulling the clothes out.I've purchased this pack twice now and as long as the price stays similar, I will continue to when needed."

I am a fan of Victoria's Secret and I purchase the same type of  panties on sale for 2 pair for $25! Of course they are better quality. I save them for my special someone. I am smart enough not use them to compare the quality of bargain panties!You just have to remember: order larger than you wear, wash on the delicate cycle, wash separate from other clothes ( my reason for buying 2 packages ) and do NOT dry.....and certainly do not ""tug"" them up...that simply means you need a larger size.

These were at a good price and looked similar to what she had before, maybe a bit more see-through than the old ones (I'm not complaining) and they seem to fit just fine.  This 5-pack was $16 I believe, and if we had replaced them at Target they sell those for 5 for $20, and VC would be probably $30 for 5 so buying this saved money for essentially the same product.

I had been looking for a cotton pantie w/lace at the waist and legs as they are more comfortable and don't squeeze. I admit that I am a very chubby girl and therefore ordered the x-large size. When they first arrived I tried them on and they actually fit very nicely maybe even a little on the big side... except the crotch was weirdly huge, it didn't sag but the placement of the seams and lining just seemed OVERLY generous. Not sure if it is like that on all sizes or just graded big for the XL. But a woman's privates don't get fatter just because her waist does! The back seam came 1/2 way up my back-side. And now that I re-look at the photos of the item you can see that seam in the back-view photo. It's actually an odd placement though which made them a little uncomfortable and kinda chaffed my tooshy. I had decided to keep them anyway and thought they would be fine to sleep in. So I threw them in the laundry. Well they shrunk... A LOT! Easily shrank 2 sizes! I can't even get them on now. Super sad. Hopefully amazon will accept the return even though I washed them."

I ordered an XL because so many reviews said it was tiny. It doesn't run small, and an XL is too big. I'm guessing those who said it was too small are referring to the bust. I'm a 36B, so the XL is much too big in the chest area. I've since bought Mediums of similar items in this brand, and they've fit perfectly. It would be nice if those who say this is ""way too small"" would mention their actual height, weight and bra size, so we can get a good idea of what size will fit."

The breast fit great and my bottoms are big as I expected since I was going a size up.  I could have gotten a small after all! In fact This material is very streachy.

I ordered an XL because so many reviews said it was tiny. It doesn't run small, and an XL is too big. I'm guessing those who said it was too small are referring to the bust. I'm a 36B, so the XL is much too big in the chest area. I've since bought Mediums of similar items in this brand, and they've fit perfectly. It would be nice if those who say this is ""way too small"" would mention their actual height, weight and bra size, so we can get a good idea of what size will fit."

And they were still really loose on me. My butt is sort of flat from having hip problems during my last pregnancy which ended 2 months ago.

So I really appreciate when companies tell you what their sizes actually mean, instead of you having to guess what size you may be.With that being said, I am usually a size 20 in jeans and picked 5x and I should have picked the 4x because these were big on me.These are also more like buttless panties as they cover your front 'area'. But I asked my boyfriend... after 😉 what he thought of them, and if he liked my other sexy panties I have more, less, or the same as these?His reply: ""Well I didn't have to take these off, which I like, so more"" (He's not a big talker)So to recap if you close or in between sizes definitely go down, and just know that they are more buttless than crochless, but my boyfriend followed me after just seeing a peek, so they are a 5 in book. 😉"

Not sure if it was a manufacturing mistake or if they were returned after they were worn. I did the old try on over your current panties trick (like with swimsuits). And they were still really loose on me. My butt is sort of flat from having hip problems during my last pregnancy which ended 2 months ago.

So I really appreciate when companies tell you what their sizes actually mean, instead of you having to guess what size you may be.With that being said, I am usually a size 20 in jeans and picked 5x and I should have picked the 4x because these were big on me.These are also more like buttless panties as they cover your front 'area'. But I asked my boyfriend... after 😉 what he thought of them, and if he liked my other sexy panties I have more, less, or the same as these?His reply: ""Well I didn't have to take these off, which I like, so more"" (He's not a big talker)So to recap if you close or in between sizes definitely go down, and just know that they are more buttless than crochless, but my boyfriend followed me after just seeing a peek, so they are a 5 in book. 😉"

I just got them in the mail and tried them on. Oh.Em.Gee. I LOVE them SO much. I ordered a size larger than normal because some of the reviews said that there run a bit small (I'm a small so I ordered a medium) and they're perfect! They feel like nothing. I feel naked, in a GOOD way. They're so stretchy but still have good structure and quality to them and they feel so comfortable. I feel beautiful. I can't believe that this whole time I thought I was ugly but it was just my ugly underwear. I truly believe now that everyone is beautiful and what you wear makes a difference and you should wear what makes you feel good about yourself.

Plesantly surprised on all aspects of these underwear! I ordered a size up based on other reviews that fit well (2XL instead of XL). I am a US pantie size 8 and US pant 14 (hips 45""). Upon examination of all seams the underwear is well contructed. There are no seams that extend over the fabric or don't extend the complete length of the fabric requiring a seam. The top of the underwear has an elastic waist around the whole top that sewn into the two layers of nylon. The front is a low rise hipster and features a full size (one sideed) cotton crotch. To top it all off, these underwear is super comfy. Personally, I find the lace and nylon to be really soft. Will be buying more!Note: if you want spandex lace underwear to last, do NOT place it in the dryer. It will destroy the spandex prematurely since it is heat sensitive."

Oh...side note...I have a really small butt and non existent hips. I ordered according to the size chart and they fit perfect.

I got the babydoll lingerie in the purple color and it is a gorgeous rich color. I am just under 5’4” and currently wear a size medium or 6-8 but I am busty, 34DD, so I sometimes have to get a large or xl in tops depending on the style and fabric. Since these are Asian sizes and looking at their sizing chart I decided to go with size extra-large.  It fit a little big so I could have gone with a size large and it would have been fine.  But where the wide ribbon ties connect to the bodice and because it ties behind the neck halter style I don’t have to worry too much about it falling down.  The lace material across the bust is very stretchy and so soft with a scalloped edge. The rest of the nightie is a soft, stretchy, flowy, sheer material.  The material is a blend of 65% polyester and 35% cotton.  The ribbons are soft, satiny, and wide and look very lush.  The panties are made from the same soft lace as the bodice.  This set is very comfortable to wear and sexy and flirty and the length hit me like a mini dress.  It is very flattering.  The care is simple, I placed it in a lingerie bag and washed it on gentle cycle cold with detergent for delicates then laid it flat to dry.  It dries quickly.  It is sewn well and I have had no loose strings or fraying.  I purchased my babydoll nightie at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

I am really impressed with the quality for the price and am planning on ordering the same piece but in black! The panties are so cute! I have recently started ordering lingerie online and most pieces come with a little g-string or thong but this comes with a lace cheeky / boy shorts type. I would love to buy a pack of these.I unfortunately did not take any photos in it (because I was ambushed by my boyfriend when he saw me trying it on ;) ). But I do plan on taking photos in it and posting as to assist anyone trying to find the right fit. I ordered an XL and the fit is great. I kind of wish I ordered a L so that it maybe could of hugged my body better and for the front to open up a bit but am already in love with it. I am 5'4, 170lbs, 12-14 in jeans, and 38c.If you are debating on buying this, definitely do! As I said before, quality is great for the price.

For years I wore a traditional fit hi waist style from Jockey.  I was very disappointed to find that Jockey was no longer making that style so I have spent the past few months searching online for something comparable.  I came across these Fruit of the Loom briefs. They are made of a very similar fabric and the fit is very comfortable.  There are a few differences between the two.  These do not have a seam down the back (which doesn't really matter to me).  These do seem slightly more stretchy but I consider that a pro not a con.  Be aware that a few of the colors shown online are not the same as the ones in the packages I received.  The colors are more in the pastel family than in the jewel tones as shown. This might be of importance to some if they are planning on color coordinating.  I personally will take comfort over color any day, particularly since it is for an article of clothing that I am going to wear under other clothing. I did get a black pair and a white pair as displayed. I got a bright (bubble gum) pink instead of the deep purple. I got a soft dove grey instead of the slate grey.  The blue is more like a powder blue.  The last pair is a pleasant light lavender."

It's incredibly breathable and stretchable in spite of the fact that it's supportive wear. It's also strong and durable when being washed and dried, unlike other types of lace that I have bought. It's forgiving yet still supportive; I don't think I've ever worn any other type of control-top underwear before that was actually effective without being constricting or ridiculously uncomfortable (I'd even go so far as to recommend buying these over more expensive brands like Spanx or Maiden Form).As for the complaints about having to order a size up:I ordered the XXL (my size in other brands) and XXXL (the size that was recommended) just to compare the fit. Although the fit in the XXL was tighter, I found it stretched out fine as I wore them; the XXXL fit more comfortably, but the biggest difference seemed to be in where the waistline hit me and that it didn't squeeze me in as much. I preferred the size up since I have a long torso and wanted more coverage. If a customer wants more support or a tighter fit, they should probably go with the smaller size."

I am not being given anything in return for this review. Just look at the pictures, it says it all. They are coming out with these exact panties in cotton. I am definately  planning on getting them if my budget allows.. I'm a panty addict.. PURCHASE!!! Also, they are pretty true to size. I usually wear between L/XL and I got an XL and they fit nice a tiny bit big but it makes them more comfy since you dont want them super tight, not panties like these where its meant to feel fabulous. Thongs are meant to be tight. Anyway with that being said - treat yourself!!!!"

The bottoms are super comfortable, it almost feels like not wearing anything at all. Be aware that the pics online are not quite accurate for the top, though. This is not a padded or push up bra. Unless your breasts naturally sit high and tight with great cleavage you just won't get that effect with the top. Still super cute, though, and I haven't had any complaints.Purple set:The bra is more of a bralette with a matching lacy thong. There is no padding and not a ton of support but it is perfect for trying to seduce my partner or wearing under a light sundress. I ordered a medium and it’s a little on the small size. I’m a 34B and it fit me my bust well but it was snug getting it over my shoulders. Once on it was very comfortable. I think women with bigger breasts would do well to order a size up.

I’m not big into leggings but have a few pair I like I wear with boots during the fall and winter. This shirt will work great for that as long as it doesn’t shrink when it’s washed. The material is soft but not too thin or see-through.The biggest problem I have with short sleeve shirts from anywhere is with my arms. They are either too tight or too short and roll up. These sleeves are a great length and very comfy. And nice for Layering over a long sleeve.  Also, the neck line is cut low but I like it that.I plan on ordering some more colors soon. The red was the perfect color and as shown.Will update the review if it changes after washing"

Runs large. Buy a cup size down & perhaps a band size down.,"November 17, 2017",Size: 34C,Color: Black Bra,"This review is for Vogue's Secret Women's Unlined Plus Size See-through Bra Sexy Lace Mesh Transparent Breathable.It should be noted that the bra and panty must be ordered separately. This is clearly said in the pictures and description but still worth saying again given they are shown in the same picture together.The item arrived with the rest of my order. The bra itself is packed in a resealable clear bag so it is visible to anyone around when you open the box.In my opinion this item is more of a special occasion bra then an everyday bra. I don't think it would last long with everyday wear and washing.On to size: The recipient measures 35-1/4” band and 37-1/2” bust, so by most sizing charts she measures to a 36B.She wears a 36B in most brands including: Playtex, Maidenform, Vassarette, XOXO and so on. But sometimes a 34B will fit better, especially when a snug fit is desirable such as a non-padded bra. For example, she has a bra similar to this item made by Calvin Klein in a 34B and it fits her perfectly.The body is fairly stretchy and doesn't offer much in the way of support. With a 34B she usually wears it on the largest hook, but on this bra the body is so stretchy it easily fit her on the on the smallest hook.The underwires sit where they should. It has a standard two hook rear closure and adjustable shoulder straps.Unfortunately the cups are simply too large. The 34B cups fit like a 34C with an undesirable extra fabric pooch on the top half of the cup. It should be noted the cups are stretchy and if you can fill them it looks just like in the item pictures.As far as fit goes you have to size this item for the cups. You can always add a black two hook band extender to add band size but cup fit can't be adjusted. I'd recommend buying a cup size down, this way the cups stretch a little to fit and look good. And given the stretchy nature of the band you may want to buy a band size down also.Why four stars?The bra is as pictured and of good quality for an occasional use item. The only real issue is fit, and fit is often a problem with bras because of their complex shape. But I can only forgive fit so far. The recipient wears a 36B or 34B in almost all other bras. I bought the smaller of the two and it was still too large, so in my opinion this item does not run true to size. - Minus one star.Overall I like the item. I would buy it again if I could get a smaller size but they don't offer one as of the time of this review. I would recommend it to a friend if they can get a size that fits them.***PS: I noticed under my name it says ""Size: 34C"" and this is incorrect. I ordered, received, and reviewed a 34B bra. The sizing sticker is visible in my picture."

When you first put it on sure you'll feel the underwires but after about half an hour I didn't feel them. The heart in the center is cute as well as the delicate lace trim on the cups. If the band wasn't so stretchy I would have given 5 stars but even using the last set of clips I still have room to wriggle around. The shoulder straps could be shorter as well. But all in all it's a very comfortable bra and I'll be ordering more but in a smaller band size.**EDIT**Boy am I glad I decided to try this bra. It's been in the mid to hight 90's in town recently but I wasn't sweating wearing this one like I would wearing thicker cup bras. Definitely need to get some more of these for next summer.**UPDATE**So after a few wearing and washing cycles the bra is now unwearable due to the band being so stretchy. After a few washes the band is too big for me, if it wasn't for the underwires keeping the band under the girls I'm sure that it would end up under my armpits every time I stretch up to get something. I really like this bra for the summer months but the band issue is a problem. I'm going to buy more but in a 40"" or even a 38"" band size."

Since this bra runs very large the first one I ordered in my size of 34DDD was huge. The underwire of the cup nearly went completely under my arm and almost touching my back. I am not petite and have 500 cc's in each breast and I had to re-order down to a size 34C. I contacted the seller via email and they responded promptly and politely. I did not have to return the bra that was too large and didn't fit, they just sent me another at no cost.The bra itself is far from luxurious but very practical for women who are looking to keep cool on hot days or when wearing a delicate top that is not harmonious with a bulky bra.The bra does not provide much support but just enough to make you feel comfortable. If you are looking for support and a minimally structured bra this is not it.The torso strap does slightly ride up the back and this could be fixed with a smaller size but they do not carry any in a 32 measurement.I highly recommend hand washing this bra and treating it with care even when wearing it.Runs very large, size down!"

They show all these various pretty colored ones and what you get is 2 pair of one style..2 pair of another style..and 2 pair of another style..then one other..then one other. So what happens, which was EXACTLY what I hoped would NOT happen..I got doubles of the ones I don't like so much and I NEVER GOT THE TWO THAT I INITIALLY ORDERED THESE FOR!!! There is nothing WORSE then to SEE what you want, PAY for it, then get NONE of the style you wanted!!

And hey, I did not expect them to be  a high quality - I know how much I paid for them, so let's be realistic here . U would not want to wear them all day long bc of uncovered elastic inside( see video),  but they would be awesome for showing off and looking pretty. One of received has a loose threads on it, but come on, I am not gonna wear them for 5 years strait , so I am ok with that. Before posting this review , I washed them twice ( in a mesh bag, regular setting) - nothing happened , and air dried - I think hot air would damage the fabric. The colors are super cheerful and omg, how bored I am of all grey/black /beige plain cotton  overwhelming the market, so those colorful panties are like a breath of fresh air ! What do u need to know : they made of thin, shiny, rustling polyester, very lightweight, become softer after washing, lightly constructed and stretch very well, have tiny cotton gusset , fit comfortably, sizing is correct ( my hips are 38, ordered size M, fit me well ),  colors are bright. Please be aware of the elastic band mentioned above - it could really irritate, so no prolong walking in this panties. Overall:  for 2.25 a pair I absolutely enjoy this flirty panties and I definitely look pretty and sexy  in them ).  4 stars instead of 5 for that uncovered elastic band."

But I asked my boyfriend... after 😉 what he thought of them, and if he liked my other sexy panties I have more, less, or the same as these?His reply: ""Well I didn't have to take these off, which I like, so more"" (He's not a big talker)So to recap if you close or in between sizes definitely go down, and just know that they are more buttless than crochless, but my boyfriend followed me after just seeing a peek, so they are a 5 in book. 😉"

For years I wore a traditional fit hi waist style from Jockey.  I was very disappointed to find that Jockey was no longer making that style so I have spent the past few months searching online for something comparable.  I came across these Fruit of the Loom briefs. They are made of a very similar fabric and the fit is very comfortable.  There are a few differences between the two.  These do not have a seam down the back (which doesn't really matter to me).  These do seem slightly more stretchy but I consider that a pro not a con.  Be aware that a few of the colors shown online are not the same as the ones in the packages I received.  The colors are more in the pastel family than in the jewel tones as shown. This might be of importance to some if they are planning on color coordinating.  I personally will take comfort over color any day, particularly since it is for an article of clothing that I am going to wear under other clothing. I did get a black pair and a white pair as displayed. I got a bright (bubble gum) pink instead of the deep purple. I got a soft dove grey instead of the slate grey.  The blue is more like a powder blue.  The last pair is a pleasant light lavender."

My original order was way too small based on the confusion of TAG 36.- I ordered a second set the same day in her US size 36C, sadly both will be returned, or exchanged since they are both too small.Bottom Line:Being a guy and having no real idea of how to go up a size makes it very difficult.

I wouldn’t recommend machine wash cause it’s SO delicate.I’m also gonna mention this cause a friend asked me.. this doesn’t hold anything in place if you maybe thought it did.. it’s extremely thin and it just stays on top of your body."

It's incredibly breathable and stretchable in spite of the fact that it's supportive wear. It's also strong and durable when being washed and dried, unlike other types of lace that I have bought. It's forgiving yet still supportive; I don't think I've ever worn any other type of control-top underwear before that was actually effective without being constricting or ridiculously uncomfortable (I'd even go so far as to recommend buying these over more expensive brands like Spanx or Maiden Form).As for the complaints about having to order a size up:I ordered the XXL (my size in other brands) and XXXL (the size that was recommended) just to compare the fit. Although the fit in the XXL was tighter, I found it stretched out fine as I wore them; the XXXL fit more comfortably, but the biggest difference seemed to be in where the waistline hit me and that it didn't squeeze me in as much. I preferred the size up since I have a long torso and wanted more coverage. If a customer wants more support or a tighter fit, they should probably go with the smaller size."

Will buy again.,"January 19, 2018",Size: 32DD,Color: Wine Red,"I'm not going to post a photo of me in this because I'm too shy (lol) but I am going to try to be specific as to how well this bra fit.Ok, so I'm mid-thirties, weigh about 130, am 5'3"" and had my last baby 18 months before I bought this. I had stopped nursing about 4 months before buying and had also just been professionally fitted (which I highly recommend!) to determine how different I was post-nursing. I'm a 32 DD but I've been experiencing  the ""where did my boobs go?!"" problem since this last baby. I was looking for something with some ""lift"" and something that felt sexy at the same time and ran across this in my amazon searches. I was hesitant but decided to try anyway and bought myself the red.First of all, to get it out of the way, the underwear isn't a perfect fit. :( I could shed some fat around my hips and these would be better but they are currently too snug; not comfy to wear. Too bad you can't select underwear size so that's where the less than 5 star rating comes in.The bra fit surprisingly well. I'm impressed. It's a very wide band with multiple hooks so unless you have someone to help you, you can always hook in front then gently twist to the back. The straps are adjustable and not too long. The underwire of the cup fit me perfectly under and around my boob so I didn't experience any pinching or stabbing in the side. I employ the ""swoop and scoop"" method when donning a bra; my girls fit very neatly in the front of the bra with no spilling over the top or sides of the front while at the same time giving a nice push up. The middle front of the bra pulls together very nicely and comfortably. I like the triangle cut-out in front as it makes it look a bit different than other bras. On me, the wide lace on the sides of the bra lays nice and flat with no tugging or rolling up.All in all, I'm very happy with this set and despite the sizing of the underwear, I will likely buy this again in another color soon!"

I was really surprised at how well it fit and how comfortable it is—and how sexy—for just over $15 (at time of this review that is the price). Wow!I honestly didn’t expect much from it. I figured it would be something fun to wear every so often and if it didn’t last or didn’t fit quite as I wanted, I wasn’t out but just under $16.00. But surprisingly I could wear this under my clothes on those times when I want to feel sexy (tee hee).The panties I am not as much of a fan and it’s the only reason I don’t give this 5 stars. They are super cute, but they don’t fit as well as the top. They run a little smaller or perhaps it’s just that the band at the top is made tighter or banded in an awkward way for me and not flattering where it hits me on my hips. I wish it had a wider band and either fit lower or something to make it not feel so constrictive—I either have to pull them up and it looks ridiculous or if I try to pull them lower it just doesn’t look right.Really, I don’t care about the panties part at all, the bra is the star here and for the money I could toss the panties and not care one bit.I love the little peek-a-boo part between the cups of the bra, the lace that goes around my upper ribcage, the wider lacy straps—it’s just a fun sexy little bra. I’m glad I purchased it! For the money, it wouldn’t matter if it only held up 6 months—I did wash it in the washer and hung it to dry before I wore it and it did just fine. It’s not going to be super-supportive for every day use if you are big busted, but, again, for those times you want to feel and look sexy it’s perfect."

I wear 38DD, and unfortunately this bra disappointed. The lace material in the band is stretchy, but too loose, so will tend to ride up your back & is very difficult to get to stay aligned properly. Additionally, the biggest let down in this piece is how the cups tend to poke out at the sides near the arm pits---I am a full DD and usually always take up all the room in the sides of the cups, this was one of the oddest bras to try on because I still had what looked like weird armpit boob peeking out, but the cups also gapped...it is just cut entirely too narrow for most any bust I'd think."

The girls hang over the top and I wish it were a little longer bc I have DDD’s, am tall (5’11”), and have a long torso - but again, it’s not custom and the price reflects that. I plan to add more feathers to fill out the top, rhinestones, and replace the bra clasp side closure with a zipper.Side note - I ordered the “blue” but it really looks more of a teal color, which I prefer, but just FYI."

However, the small was on sale as a add on item for less than $5! When I received it, I knew it would be a little small for me. So, I used some sturdier strings to re-lace the back (it comes laced with ribbon). The sturdier strings allowed me to lace it more according to my size. Very happy with the product. Looks elegant and expensive. I will say that the metal hooks on the front can be a little tricky to latch and unlatch. And I don't think it would be super comfy to wear for long periods of time. However, the boning was great, very sturdy and did not poke. Overall, it was a nice item."

I even had more clothes on under it that I was going to for the costume. However, I put it on an hour later and the zipper kept busting open (and it still wasn't tight, just wouldn't keep the zipper). Finally - after 45 minutes of messing around and having it bust, me and a friend got it up (again - not tight at all - just zipper malfunction) and it stayed shut but I kept it pretty loose which was unfortunate as I wanted it a bit together.  Still, I do like it a lot and would even get it in different colors but would want fully functioning zipper.  The rest seems pretty quality - this should be too."

I just got them in the mail and tried them on. Oh.Em.Gee. I LOVE them SO much. I ordered a size larger than normal because some of the reviews said that there run a bit small (I'm a small so I ordered a medium) and they're perfect! They feel like nothing. I feel naked, in a GOOD way. They're so stretchy but still have good structure and quality to them and they feel so comfortable. I feel beautiful. I can't believe that this whole time I thought I was ugly but it was just my ugly underwear.

Plesantly surprised on all aspects of these underwear! I ordered a size up based on other reviews that fit well (2XL instead of XL). I am a US pantie size 8 and US pant 14 (hips 45""). Upon examination of all seams the underwear is well contructed. There are no seams that extend over the fabric or don't extend the complete length of the fabric requiring a seam. The top of the underwear has an elastic waist around the whole top that sewn into the two layers of nylon. The front is a low rise hipster and features a full size (one sideed) cotton crotch. To top it all off, these underwear is super comfy. Personally, I find the lace and nylon to be really soft. Will be buying more!Note: if you want spandex lace underwear to last, do NOT place it in the dryer. It will destroy the spandex prematurely since it is heat sensitive."

I wash them the right way so the last hopefully. I'd buy more. I'm not much for recommending undies but if you need some these are really nice. Oh...side note...I have a really small butt and non existent hips. I ordered according to the size chart and they fit perfect.

I am not being given anything in return for this review. Just look at the pictures, it says it all. They are coming out with these exact panties in cotton. I am definately  planning on getting them if my budget allows.. I'm a panty addict.. PURCHASE!!! Also, they are pretty true to size. I usually wear between L/XL and I got an XL and they fit nice a tiny bit big but it makes them more comfy since you dont want them super tight, not panties like these where its meant to feel fabulous. Thongs are meant to be tight. Anyway with that being said - treat yourself!!!!"

I am smart enough not use them to compare the quality of bargain panties!You just have to remember: order larger than you wear, wash on the delicate cycle, wash separate from other clothes ( my reason for buying 2 packages ) and do NOT dry.....and certainly do not ""tug"" them up...that simply means you need a larger size.

Straps are close enough together that they don't jump off my shoulders all the time. When I wear a low-cut crop top, the front straps are pretty sexy and nice. The bra is padded cups with light weight. I'm not scared to bend over and fall out, the workmanship looks good. It’s still comfortable after wearing it for a long period of time. Some reviews says the panties are small, I’m lucky mine is perfect fit. If too small, I’ll present it to my sister. I’m going on a trip next month, I’ll take the bra panty set with me. So excited!!"

I had been looking for a cotton pantie w/lace at the waist and legs as they are more comfortable and don't squeeze. I admit that I am a very chubby girl and therefore ordered the x-large size. When they first arrived I tried them on and they actually fit very nicely maybe even a little on the big side... except the crotch was weirdly huge, it didn't sag but the placement of the seams and lining just seemed OVERLY generous. Not sure if it is like that on all sizes or just graded big for the XL. But a woman's privates don't get fatter just because her waist does! The back seam came 1/2 way up my back-side. And now that I re-look at the photos of the item you can see that seam in the back-view photo. It's actually an odd placement though which made them a little uncomfortable and kinda chaffed my tooshy. I had decided to keep them anyway and thought they would be fine to sleep in. So I threw them in the laundry. Well they shrunk... A LOT! Easily shrank 2 sizes! I can't even get them on now. Super sad. Hopefully amazon will accept the return even though I washed them."

Not sure if it was a manufacturing mistake or if they were returned after they were worn. I did the old try on over your current panties trick (like with swimsuits). And they were still really loose on me. My butt is sort of flat from having hip problems during my last pregnancy which ended 2 months ago. And the top of the underwear run right along my c-section scar.. so my belly kind of hangs over them.. ick. But if you’ve got a bubble butt and no belly overhang, This might look good on you.

So I really appreciate when companies tell you what their sizes actually mean, instead of you having to guess what size you may be.With that being said, I am usually a size 20 in jeans and picked 5x and I should have picked the 4x because these were big on me.These are also more like buttless panties as they cover your front 'area'. But I asked my boyfriend... after 😉 what he thought of them, and if he liked my other sexy panties I have more, less, or the same as these?His reply: ""Well I didn't have to take these off, which I like, so more"" (He's not a big talker)So to recap if you close or in between sizes definitely go down, and just know that they are more buttless than crochless, but my boyfriend followed me after just seeing a peek, so they are a 5 in book. 😉"

I can tell the difference! They're a bit low rise for my taste. I might have sized up to fix that, but I'm normally a small, and they're not uncomfortable. The V is nice and wide, and I'm tall so sometimes I have the issue of the back riding up the front if the front isn't wide enough. The back isn't too thick or uncomfy, either. I washed them before wearing (I hope everyone does lol), and they may have shrunk a little bit. I have super small hips so maybe that's better. I've washed a couple pairs a second time now, and they haven't fallen apart, but do have some strings where the sides are sewn. I'd buy more! Better than expected for the price."

Very soft. I'm talking these are comfey. Everywhere.Not too skimpy, and not too much. Just the right amount of material width on hips.Well made and good quality - so surprised because I mean look at the price... The colors are bright and deep too. Very pretty.So yes! The price is amazing!! I can not emphasize this enough for what I received for a package of this many.And a true test again - they washed up FANTASTIC - kept shape, and feel GREAT.Tag is small and on the side - not in the way!!I bought a package of each - with the bow/deco lines, and one plain. The only difference is the decoration bow and black bead line.A giant leap to buy undies on Amazon - I buy almost everything else but I never thought... But I went for it and am so glad I did. As a gal I had to write this review. I appreciate honest reviews because they help me.I'm 5'4 105lbs and took the small. They are perfect."

To me, the perfect panty does the following:1. Available in black (can't see blood stains)2. Lace waistline (elastic that's not large and flat leaves a line)3. NO ELASTIC around the leg (because all women are different and NONE of us have the same waist to hip to thigh ratio. Give me a break... no one wants elastic up their crotch or along a razor line)4. A substantial liner, for the occasional surprise-early monthly visitor.5. A natural fiber, but preferably something that doesn't hold water like cotton. (beechwood fiber or merino woven to feel like like cotton would fit the bill)This panty fits all but #4. There is a double fabric liner, and it's better than most panties, but it's not exactly what I want.#5 is close enough, but I would prefer a fabric that doesn't crave water like cotton. The only manufacturer that seems to understand that at all is MeUndies... but they have the problem with the waistline, cost too much, and also have an unsubstantial liner.I will continue my hunt, but these will get me through in the meantime. I gave them 4 stars because they are the best I have found."

I considered buying a size larger because I have both higher hips and love handles and in this case, I needed the waist band to lay absolutely flat with no muffin top. But I also didn't want it to be too loose on my narrower hips/butt, so ended up ordering an L. Fortunately, the lace waist band is very stretchy and non-constricting - it lays pretty flat. Having tried it on though, I can now say even the size XL would have stretched to fit and not been too loose. The legs do roll up on me slightly, especially on the inner side.

For reference... body type is apple and I usually wear size 8 or 9, but 9 are always too big in the legs and ride up. The size XL here had leg openings that were just a little bit large for me but after one wash and dry, they are perfect. having shrunk just a tiny bit. They sit right at the waist, no rolling, bunching or pinching anywhere, very soft, no compression but perfectly snuggish so that it's easy to get clothes on over them. After a half dozen washes/machine drying, they remain the same size. No more shrinkage after the initial little bit. The pictures shown are accurate for me (except the model is smaller haha.)

I though it was great for the price, but the quality, especially around the collar, is on the lower side. It also has a peculiar odor, which I can only assume is because of the dye. The smell did get better with washing. Another draw back, though I have been able to ignore it because I'm usually otherwise occupied, are the bum strings. This lingerie has no lower covering and the strings that help keep it on your body tend to slip. Overall I love this lingerie."

These are so comfortable!!!  I had no idea what I was missing.  The lace is sturdier than on any lingerie I’ve ever worn.  It doesn’t feel like it’ll disintegrate in the wash.  They don’t ride up much at all, for a full coverage panty anyway.  I was quite impressed with the all-day comfort.  I love vintage clothes and already wear a lot of high waisted trousers and skirts, so these work great with my wardrobe, but be aware that these will show with low or even mid-rise jeans."

My measurements are 36/28/36 with D breaths and the Large fit my very well.  It was not too tight Or too lose anywhere.  The color was as expected and the fabric was soft and comfortable. My problem with this piece was the “fringe” pattern on the bra cups, on the fabric under the bra cups, and on the panty.  Instead of it being a quality fringe, it was just some threads that were sparse and cheap looking.  Over all, they made the piece look unfinished and almost ragged.  Even if you washed the set and laid it flat to dry, I don’t think the fringe threads would ever be straight or nice looking.  If it weren’t for the fringe I would’ve kept this piece.

For me, this is a gem. Because it is not that easy to find cute lace panties with wide comfortable crotch. I will purchase this again. Totally recommend!!"

The fit is is almost perfect. It makes me feel beautiful and sexy for my husband even after having multiple children and surgeries. It flows right over the tummy and just to right below the buttocks. Shows all the right places. The top ties so you can adjust it.  I’m a 36C and I look pretty good.  So if you are bigger this will be great and if you are smaller you can just tighten the ties and it will look great too.The only thing I don’t like, and it’s not even that I don’t like it if I’d gotten a smaller size it wouldn’t bother me. There’s a “x” of fabric between the lace of the breasts and it’s loose on me.  I have to get a larger sizes due to a large rib cage because of lung problems.So even if you are a 40 something ☺️ or older woman who doesn't have a ""perfect"" body (no one does) this is pardon the pun perfect."

I ordered a large in this lingerie set after reading reviews, but I feel as if I should have stuck with my normal size of medium. The bralette in this set fit me but was looser than I would have liked even with the chest band at the tightest setting. Still sexy, though... the garter belt also fit, but was once again a bit loose, even on the tightest hook. If I would have ordered a medium, both of these would have probably been perfect for me, but I kept the set anyways and still rock it. The panties were much too small for me. Tight, uncomfortable, the “triangular” portion that’s supposed to cover your goods in the front  was much too small. I just threw them away and wore a different pair of black lace panties that I already owned. All in all, good set, just stick to ordering your normal size and be prepared to replace the panties (I feel like that’s a common problem with most lingerie sets you order online). My boyfriend thought this set was incredibly sexy. PS - IT DOES NOT COME WITH THIGH HIGHS OR STOCKING OF ANY KIND - YOU HAVE TO ORDER THOSE SEPARATELY!"

I really have struggled with lingerie in the past. Whether it was too big, too small, or I just didn't feel cute in it. I bought this for Valentine's Day. When I first tried it on the cups (where the lace and cup meet) were pretty pointy. I thought that I would need to sew it or fix it somehow. I decided to wear it for a little bit to see if it relaxed more under my shirt. Thankfully, it relaxed and looked super cute. I also bought the burgundy color and it's true to the picture. Exactly the color I wanted.I don't think this is something I would personally wear everyday because I don't like lace all that much, but it is surprisingly comfortable if you wanted to do so. I bought th 38D, which is my normal size, and it fit perfectly. It came with XXL undies, they fit like a large from Victoria's Secret so I wouldn't say they are a true XXL. Probably more on the XL side, at least in my experience.Overall I really love this set. I think it will wash well, and it makes me feel sexy (and that's hard to do these days!).

I'm pleasantly surprised!The bra is cute and fits pretty well.  I'm normally a 34DD so I wasn't quite sure how to order because DD was not an option.  So I consulted Victoria Secret's ""sister sizing"" chart to double check what the equivalent would be, and it's 36D.  But I was nervous because so many reviewers said it runs small, so I ordered 36D's ""sister size"" of 38C.  Whew that was a lot of numbers!The bra is CUTE!  It fits pretty well, but I'm wondering if I would have been better off ordering the 36D. (At this price, I might just order the smaller size anyway!)  It was NOT a push-up bra, though maybe it would be in the smaller size.  And the panties actually fit (was NOT expecting that, based on the other reviews).  The lace is pretty soft.  Basically, Wal-Mart price but not Wal-Mart quality.  And isn't that the dream?I'm rating this a 4-star product instead of 5-stars because the shape looks kinda weird under clothes.  It's lumpy and pointy.  It's sexy with the shirt off, to be sure, but if you plan on surprising someone with what's underneath your shirt...not so much."

I found the XL to be a perfect fit for me, though I would prefer a lower rise, as I'm quite short in the hip, but rolling the waist over to give a lower rise should be easy enough. I have a 39"" waist and 53"" hips, and there is plenty of room in both for a larger person, so the sizing is comfy and generous. I have problems wearing elastic on my waist, as it usually causes uncomfortable pressure and back pain, but the elastic on these is thin enough that I don't have any problems. The lace ruffles are from the top of the hip bone down to the bottom, as shown in the picture, so your skirts will glide over the top part of the shorts easily, as they're satin in that area. The tag is actually on the outside, not the inside, so I was momentarily confused, though this may be a fluke on my pair. I will happily purchase other colors of these shorts in the future, should I need them, as the value for the price is outstanding. The seams are sound, and the fabric is sturdy. I don't have to worry about the lace itching, because it's on the outside and won't be touching my skin. I highly recommend these shorts if you're looking for a lacy, ruffled short."

I absolutely love these. My only complaint is a personal preference, so I'm giving them a 5 star review and just putting the 'con' out there to warn others with sensory issues.Pros:  - SUPER stretchy! I went for an XL because that's what I bought swim bottoms in this year, and I -might- have been able to get away with the L because of how much stretch these have.  -  Cute! They definitely are adorable bloomers!  I was worried they'd come all scrunched looking and the lace would be sticking out in odd ways, but the were nicely folded and looked fine on.  - They have a mesh gusset for airflow. Definitely a necessity, especially in the warmer seasons.Cons  - Lace and inside of bloomers are itchy/scratchy. I hate rough/coarse fabrics and avoid them whenever possible. It's a sensory thing.  The lace is really, really scratchy feeling. It's not soft at all, though keep in mind lace generally isn't. I could deal with this a little better if the inside was lined. While the lace isn't on the inside, the stitching and fabric still lead to a distracting sensory situation in the nether parts. Even a super thin lining of a software/sleeker material would be helpful here. Thankfully, I do have black boy short style undies, which will help mitigate some of the sensation. Definitely don't expect to wear only these if you have are particular about fabrics."

I bought the Large because I am a Womens size 10 pant size. Material is very soft. However when I washed the underwear in the machine for the first time on the delicate setting in cool water, I noticed that the lace was already starting to show some wear. There are also a number of loose threads and the bows on a few pairs have come undone and the ends of the ribbons of the bows are already starting to fray. Mind you this is all from ONE wash - I decided to hang dry them to avoid further damage. They're cute, and I think the underwear overall will last, but the details definitely wont. If you get these wash them by hand (or in a lingerie bag) and air dry.UPDATE: Ok they are MUCH worse than I originally thought. Washed them for the second time last night and the lace on a few of the pairs is already almost completely frayed. The quality seems inconsistent for each pair - some are fine, others are starting to look like a disaster only two washes later. I would not recommend buying these underwear for their cute factor."

The V is nice and wide, and I'm tall so sometimes I have the issue of the back riding up the front if the front isn't wide enough. The back isn't too thick or uncomfy, either. I washed them before wearing (I hope everyone does lol), and they may have shrunk a little bit. I have super small hips so maybe that's better.

I thought the 5x would be a tad too small if not spot on, based off the reviews and size chart. But they are pretty big on me. The lace around the butt part just kind of hangs off me and doesn’t look good at all. The tag appears to be ripped out of them as well. Not sure if it was a manufacturing mistake or if they were returned after they were worn. I did the old try on over your current panties trick (like with swimsuits). And they were still really loose on me. My butt is sort of flat from having hip problems during my last pregnancy which ended 2 months ago. And the top of the underwear run right along my c-section scar.. so my belly kind of hangs over them.. ick. But if you’ve got a bubble butt and no belly overhang, This might look good on you.

So I really appreciate when companies tell you what their sizes actually mean, instead of you having to guess what size you may be.With that being said, I am usually a size 20 in jeans and picked 5x and I should have picked the 4x because these were big on me.These are also more like buttless panties as they cover your front 'area'. But I asked my boyfriend... after 😉 what he thought of them, and if he liked my other sexy panties I have more, less, or the same as these?His reply: ""Well I didn't have to take these off, which I like, so more"" (He's not a big talker)So to recap if you close or in between sizes definitely go down, and just know that they are more buttless than crochless, but my boyfriend followed me after just seeing a peek, so they are a 5 in book. 😉"

It arrived in great condition, well-packed and all that. I tried it on for size - all good. It snugs in at all the right places, and does not feel like it is rolling up/ down while at the same time I can breathe. There's just one small problem that I can foresee... there's no crotch opening. I will be wearing a dress and a crinoline with this. I'm trying to imagine being in a tiny stall in a public restroom trying to wrestle this thing down past all that AND worse still, back up. The event is eight hours long, so it will be an interesting time. I'm giving it a go because it really does a good job at shaping which is its primary function. However, I would ask the manufacturer to have a heart. Once you have all that spandex situated just so, you sure don't want to have to do it over and over again. Let's face it, most women will reserve this type of undergarment for special occasions where she is already putting up with heels, netting, slips, static cling, push-up bras, and heaven forbid hosiery. The least manufacturers can do is make going to the bathroom an activity that doesn't require two lady's maids and a crowbar."

Unfortunately, both were too tight in the butt area and dug into my skin, which would be obvious under pants.  I returned them and debated whether or not to try a medium, thinking they would definitely be too big.  I decided to try anyway and they were, in fact, too large.

It started out okay, but eventually loosened up and moved around a lot. The other problem (for me) is the crotch which is cut slim (my bits don't feel fully covered) and is heavily lined. The latter is nice, but considering the looseness it becomes uncomfortable over time. The pluses: it is a well made garment; the color is beautiful; the lace is quality and has a bit of give; there were no panty lines under leggings. It you are a fan of thongs but would like a little more modesty in the rear, I'd give this a go (provided the sizing works for you)."

It fits perfect! If you are the same as my exact sizing above, go with the same size I did. Some who are the same sizing as me with a little more breast or tummy should go up one size.About the lingerie...It's really made of a nice quality. Not cheapy at all. The blue color is vibrant and a true blue like the image. The crotch is open and the back fastens like a typical bra but there is no underwire or support for the breast. I will be ordering the other colors very soon."

Sanchez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sexy as heck!,"August 11, 2019",Size: XX-Large (fits like US X-Large),Color: Black,I was amazed with the quality. I work in an adult store and even with my discount lingerie is too expensive. I never trusted ordering online but with a bonus check decided to give it a try. The lace feels nice on my flesh and I have never seen my husband as turned on as he was when he saw me in this set. I have had six children I am 5’9” and 160 lbs. I ordered an extra large knowing lingerie fits me differently than clothing sizes I normally wear large in. This is definitely going to be a favorite of ours. Easy access for us to have the most amazing intimate time. Easy to slip into. I also kept looking at myself in the mirror. If this company would be willing to send me product to model in without my face I would be completely willing to send unedited photos without my face and just blocking out private areas. It is so important to feel sexy as a woman I just regret waiting until age 36 to discover this. Very happy. Thank You!

I, for one, love my curves, but I also know what is flattering on me and what isn't. Unfortunately, I have to wear a dress this holiday season for a wedding that is NOT flattering on me. I've purchased and returned, and researched multiple items on Amazon in hopes to find the ideal undergarment that would work to flatter me. From Spanx to complicated contraptions- none seemed to flatter me. I felt like a tube of Pillsbury dough rolls that had just been popped open with the dough spilling out at the seems. Luckily, I ran into these babies.Here we go!Firstly, I value comfort. These have all the comfort of your favorite granny parties.Secondly, the strategic placement of the lace actually works to smooth out love handles WITHOUT SQUEEZING THEM, thus avoiding the Pillsbury dough phenomenon.Thirdly, it's not a body shaper, but it does have some tummy control. It smooths out problem areas rather than aim to make you look like you've lost a few inches.Overall, I'm really impressed by the quality and ability for this product to fulfill its advertised purpose. I can't get over how adorably retro these look."

Instead, with how the lower lace is see-through, it gives me a vintage pin up vibe when I first tried them on. I purchased these since I love high waisted briefs as a way to give myself support as a result of a minor childhood injury that flares up once and a while.These have a very well sewn waist, with perfect elastic! They have not ridden down or curled up once since I bought them, and I have not had any defective pairs. That being said, the elastic is not tight enough to hurt when sitting as some of the tighter elastics can, and the lace is still sturdy at the edges, just offering a tasteful window underneath. The top lace is not sheer, but that seems obvious in the pictures of the product anyway.As for the shape wear properties, I cannot say for sure, since I didn't need them for that reason. That being said I did notice a bit of a lift on the back, which was nice, and it did smooth down the overall skin, from what I could tell. I would recommend this product to anyone needing support in their lower abdomen, or looking for modest sexy panties.One last thing to mention that was not quite 5 star worthy: A few of the pink/neutral pairs had a smell I can only describe as chemical/almost fecal? I washed them before putting them on and that got the smell out, but it's worth mentioning it may have been the dye that smelled after being brand new and shoved in a plastic package at who knows what temperature while it shipped."

The ONLY knitpick is that the lace along the bottom was sewn along the edge, but the top half was not sewn flush, so it rolls down.

(I’m 5’3” and never considered myself long in the torso) It is not just crotchless, it’s buttless too.. the fabric does spread so it covers a bit. But the slit from the front goes aallll the way up the butt too. Super sexy and great material. It just didn’t look that way on my post partum body. The slit part went up pretty far.. it spread open over my belly and my c-section scar. So it was giving a sneak peek of what I was trying to hide. If i adjusted the straps to move the waist down to cover the scar, my boobs looked saggy and spread apart. It just wasn’t for me sadly."

I sized down because people said the material was stretchy, which it is. My problems were the straps being too STRECTHY and the fabric of the panties. The panties roll down with vigorous movement, due to sizing. I would've gotten the X-large but fixed the straps to my liking (probably sewing the straps down across the back or neck area). I chose the red color. Very pretty color choice for me, just wrong sizing."

First let me say I ordered a 2x (18) and while it technically fits, the band that goes under the breasts isn't wide enough to give the same look as in the photos. Don't get me wrong, I don't think I'm suddenly going to look like the model, I did expect the proportions to be the same but the band doesn't go far enough down the ribs to have the same type of look. The breast ""cup"" portion also doesn't really seem scaled up to the right size, my nipple is barely still under it. It is very comfortable and stretchy but not appropriate for under a tank bc there is no support. The underwear isn't lined and looks the exact same from front and back so it isn't immediately apparent which direction you should wear it and probably would not be good for day wear. Basically if you're plus size the bra is not going to look very good and if you want this to wear as a comfy, no wire, day time bra then keep looking. If you are just looking for something for the bedroom then this is a good choice."

I suggest ordering your usual thong size, since I would have been a size medium according to their chart (every body is different).  These are cute, sexy thongs!  It's so hard to find cotton nude colored thongs to wear under lighter colored leggings or leggings that might not be 100% squat-proof.  These thongs fit the bill.  I washed them in a lingerie bag in cold water, then hung to dry.  I haven't noticed any ripping or pilling in the lace as other reviews have stated, which is probably due to my use of the lingerie bag.  I can see how the lace might get caught on and destroyed by zippers and buttons of other garments.  The lace is stretchy, and very comfy.  The V coverage is just right, and made of cotton!  I don't like the idea of synthetic material in my nether-region for health reasons.  These don't pinch, slide, or ride up, but the lace band has a tendency of rolling down sometimes at my hips.  Not a major issue, but if you're curvy, the band might never lay flat.  I wear these under shorts, jeans, and leggings at the gym.  If these last through the year, I'll definitely buy more!"

When I put it on again, it felt too tight around the middle.  I still think it's adorable and a great price - it's more that I hate anything tight around my middle - that's partly why I don't wear bras unless I really have to.Color me green/lucky! I  ordered this on April 19th and I really like this bralette! It actually fits me well and is representative of the actual size it purports to be!  I ordered a medium and that's what I got.  I will say it's not that tight around the middle part but I like that - I don't like anything tight under rmy breasts - hence why I don't buy bras usually. I also heard that restriction to your breasts is not good. Easy for me to say right? I'm a 34B! I hear all you ladies out there that are larger and don't have a choice in terms of having to wear wire bras or ones that keep you ""in"" but I am saying, if/when possible? Let the girls roam!  I feel really lucky that I am small busted because it allows me the freedom to wear bralettes and be a litlte bit more casual/free.  The price on this bralette is also really good and I actually like the color a lot - while not a beige - that blends in - it is kind of neutral/or a quiet green if you will.  Oh, it also comes with a pretty little bag!  If you're wondering whether to get it? Go for it! It comes in red as well and I may buy that one as well!"

First, the lace is relatively soft, which is my main issue with most laces panties (scratchy lace). Second, they are wide enough up front to accomodate things most of the time. Now, I took off 2 stars for a couple reasons. The waist elastic is not very stretchy. I am a mens US medium, which is typically a womens large\7. So I ordered a large; however, it is somewhat tight in the waist. Also, the back, even though it is sexy, does not even try to stay in place. Just walking makes the back ride up, making this a little uncomfortable for daily wear."

When I put it on again, it felt too tight around the middle.  I still think it's adorable and a great price - it's more that I hate anything tight around my middle - that's partly why I don't wear bras unless I really have to.Color me green/lucky! I  ordered this on April 19th and I really like this bralette! It actually fits me well and is representative of the actual size it purports to be!  I ordered a medium and that's what I got.  I will say it's not that tight around the middle part but I like that - I don't like anything tight under rmy breasts - hence why I don't buy bras usually. I also heard that restriction to your breasts is not good. Easy for me to say right? I'm a 34B! I hear all you ladies out there that are larger and don't have a choice in terms of having to wear wire bras or ones that keep you ""in"" but I am saying, if/when possible? Let the girls roam!  I feel really lucky that I am small busted because it allows me the freedom to wear bralettes and be a litlte bit more casual/free.  The price on this bralette is also really good and I actually like the color a lot - while not a beige - that blends in - it is kind of neutral/or a quiet green if you will.

First, the lace is relatively soft, which is my main issue with most laces panties (scratchy lace). Second, they are wide enough up front to accomodate things most of the time. Now, I took off 2 stars for a couple reasons. The waist elastic is not very stretchy. I am a mens US medium, which is typically a womens large\7. So I ordered a large; however, it is somewhat tight in the waist. Also, the back, even though it is sexy, does not even try to stay in place. Just walking makes the back ride up, making this a little uncomfortable for daily wear."

Super weird & definitely noticable.Also as most mentioned, they are very high-rise, not at all how pictured on the model, so I will now have to sew this in 2 spots to be decently ready for Valentine’s Day in 2 days, which isn’t that easy when lace is involved.(Edit:  since I sewed & shortened the panties by a little over 1 inch, the overal band is much too tight, as it was supposed to be distributed evenly on both sides.  Unfortunately, still unwearable.)Don’t have complaints about the bra, I’m usually a 36-38 D & weigh ~180lbs & a XL fit me, maybe a tiny bit snug so I could’ve possibly fit in a size up if I wanted)"

They would be a bit sexier if they were all sheer lace (and lacked that satiny panel in the front) and if the waistband was totally seamless (and lacked the thick elastic band that shows through and may dig in).  But the raw seamless edges around the legs and sheer rear do help with the sexy factor.  They are flattering, incredibly soft, and very comfortable!  But I am a 99.9% thong wearer - so I can't compare them to any sort of full coverage bikini brief type item.  The lace has a nice stretch to it and doesn't feel cheap or itchy.  The crotch liner (95% cotton/5% spandex - NOT 100% cotton, as stated) is white on all colors (black, navy, pink, nude, white) in my pack, which is a fail for me.  Sometimes you need a good black granny panty during that time of the month - and with white lining, just no.  Plus, the lining is way too low, like, at the butt and doesn't protect lady parts.  So far, they do very well in the laundry (machine wash, dry flat).  I was fully expecting them to be too big since I really am an XXS, but they fit reasonably well with the stretch.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4, as they are well-priced."

I accidentally ordered a small for some reason when I should have ordered a medium. Old habits I suppose. I am 5’4. 120 lbs, 28in waist and 38in hips. The smalls do fit me kind of snugly but not too small to where I cannot wear them. They aren’t cutting into me or anything. But they are not as high waisted as the photo shows. They kind of look like just normal bikini cut panties when on. I think that’s because I ordered the small and I needed the medium. And what the heck is with the WHITE cotton gusset in these black panties? My period will destroy this. Might as well just reach in my underwear drawer on my heaviest flow day and choose the whitest underwear I have. Other than all that I like them. I think I’ll just keep them instead of exchanging them because I tried one on and that’s just gross to return. Even tho I only wore it for maybe 30 seconds. Still. I wouldn’t want to purchase panties that a stranger already wore. But if were to order these again I would for sure get a medium. And if I end up liking these enough to where I wear them a lot in my regular rotation, I’ll probably sew a black cotton gusset in myself, so I can wear them any day of the month :)"

The underwire of the cup fit me perfectly under and around my boob so I didn't experience any pinching or stabbing in the side. I employ the ""swoop and scoop"" method when donning a bra; my girls fit very neatly in the front of the bra with no spilling over the top or sides of the front while at the same time giving a nice push up. The middle front of the bra pulls together very nicely and comfortably. I like the triangle cut-out in front as it makes it look a bit different than other bras. On me, the wide lace on the sides of the bra lays nice and flat with no tugging or rolling up.All in all,  I will likely buy this again in another color soon!"

The side of the bottom with the seam in the back. This information might save you some time. I put it on backwards at first and the bottoms didn’t fit properly until i took them off and tried the other way. Trust me, it will look and feel really funny if you put them on wrong 😂After I got in one correctly, it fit well and looked cute. I’m 5’8, 148 pounds so I got a medium.

I am 5'4"" on a good day, and wear a 1X in most women's clothes, or a 16W. I ordered a 5X because it made sense according to the chart. It fit well with the usual corset adjustments, loosening laces, putting it on and closing it up, then the final lace tightening.Unlike those lucky women who are curvy and beautiful, I am lumpy and frumpy. Think apple rather than pear. Only the apple has gone mushy. Looking for a way to dress up the old apple, I took a deep breath and ordered this corset based on the reviews. Given the price and knowing it wasn't bone, I must admit that I wasn't expecting much but figured I wasn't throwing away that much money if it wasn't what I wanted.I was pleasantly surprised, it was quite lovely. The red color was bright but rich and not cheesy at all, and the pattern was pretty. I quietly ducked into the closet just to try it on. As it was my first corset ever, I struggled with it for a little while but applying a bit of common sense really went a long way. I was red-faced from my struggles but not entirely unhappy with the overall result. I took it off and tucked it in a drawer and forgot about it.A few weeks later, when I was at home on a vacation day and the hubby at work, I thought I'd give it another go. I had bought a garter belt and stockings at the same time as this corset, and along with a pair of heels I'd never worn before but were very sexy, I managed to get myself all dolled up for my first ever selfie shoot. I kid you not when I say that this corset made me feel so much better about myself because it smoothed out my trouble spots and made even my mushy apple body look amazing. I even felt so new and exciting that I sent a few of the pics to the unsuspecting husband at work. He LOVED it, and I felt wonderful.I've since purchased two more in other colors and styles, just waiting for the right time to wear them. It is not an exaggeration to say that this little inexpensive item I bought on a whim a few weeks ago actually changed my life."

I don’t like thongs or g-stings.  I bought one of these to try.  We liked it so much, I bought more in different colors. I wear these most of the time now.  We like my ass being bare.  Always ready for sensuous quick grabs and back door sex.  Hands, finger, tongue, other male parts slide in quickly, no need to undress. I wear a lot more gathered skirts since I got these!  Or, just a bathrobe!  Hint:  If you’re wearing a skirt, skip the panty hose. If you must wear nylons, wear a garter belt, so you’re ready for a quickie; at the office, parties,  in the car, on a plane, kitchen, or when kids/ mom and dad are in next room asleep or  watching tv.  More exciting, quick sex on the sly without getting caught! Kind of like being a teen in a car again.Just don’t make a lot of noise and no one will be the wiser.  These don’t work for front door.  What I like about these is that the fabric covers areas where you drip, so your outer clothing is protected.  However, sometimes,  I’ve put in liners because I get wet down there just thinking about what these will do for me.  Like right now as I’m doing this review.  Sofshie is a good brand.  I’ve been happy with everything I’ve purchased. Alternate these with the open crotch, front door models that they make.  That said, you can plan ahead for which door  you wish to use. You can keep it a surprise; imagine what fun it will be to decide in advance which game YOU want to play and surprise your partner with what YOU want and how YOU want to play."

They are obviously mens boxer briefs that they just added extra material In The crotch and market them to women. The problems with this is mens shorts are made with more room in front and less in the back because of the way a mans body is shaped. They are NOT made to fit a womans body so when I put them on they went way too high in the front and very low in the back. They even have stitching in the front that was made for a mans package. Unless you are shaped like a man and have a belly and no rear end these wont fit. I did give them 2 stars of love because the material is very soft.

They both said they did exactly what they were hoping for no more rubbing thighs in dresses. These arrived fast / on time. I love it when company's get their products to me when they say they will. To me that speaks volumes for the company. I have in the past dealt with some pretty crappy customer service but that is definitely not the case with this company. They have both worn them all day and said they were very comfortable soft and breathable. They both did report that they do slightly slide up from sitting to standing but they did both also say it does not do it so much that it's annoying. These cotton briefs / shorts are not as long as pictured but they are close to the length pictured. Bottom line these are comfortable and exactly what my wife and daughter was looking to get. We will buy these again in the near future when they need more or a different colored pairs.Update : After having these for a couple months now they still fit them great and are still comfortable and overall holding up great and they wear these at least two to three days a week.Honest customer reviews are very important to me because I always rely on them before I purchase almost anything online.

The label on the package says Yoga - Workout Shorts with an MSRP of $45 for the three-pack. There’s nothing sexy about them —unless you think red is sexy. (But it probably says “sexy” on the other colors.) I’ll just put it down to an over-exuberant copy writer. They’re certainly not likely to increase the sex appeal of chubby women!I’m looking for non-chafing undies to wear under my fantastic Macabi travel skirts. These are fine for the long skirts but probably a bit too long (I’m under 5’ and they come to about 2” above my knees) for the knee-length skirt. And that’s why I chose red. Thinking they’ll be cooler if they peek out.  But they won’t be cooler in temperature although 95% cotton and 5% spandex seems to be a pretty a good combination. They’re not sheer but are definitely much lighter weight, say, than cotton knit shorts or even most capri-length, knit, exercise pants. (Made in Bangladesh).I was going to order XXL based on the “happy size 16 thighs” review, but with a way too tight XL from another brand lying around, I decided to play it safe and order the XXXL.  The package came with two XXL and one XXXL!! Held up together they appear to be the same size. And there is no noticeable difference in tightness when I tried them on. What can I tell you? The quality seems OK but who knows how long they will last. Having 3 pairs will stretch out their longevity. (Ha! An unintended pun there)They do stretch so that undies would probably be visible but would work out fine as gym (or whatever) shorts if you wear a long T-shirt that covers your butt and the top of your thighs (or just use pantiliners). The shade is a nice, bright orangie red as opposed to cherry red (more warm than cool red).  I certainly would be willing to order the other color options tho I’ll keep looking for a slightly shorter length (too hard to cut and sew stretchy knit fabric). Price was good.Update: I grabbed a pair and lo and behold: they DID feel a bit loose and they WERE the 3XL. Sooo. If you’re closer to size 18 than 16 get the 3XL. I think a size 20 gal would be OK with them as well."

It holds in what you want to be held in, and pushes up what you want pushed up.  I wasn't worried about falling out of it and was able to spend the whole night dancing and walking around in comfort (as much as you can in a cinched corset, of course).

The XL fits well. One great feature I didn't understand before I received the corset is that it has a hidden zipper. You can adjust the laces to where they fit you and keep them tied. This is really helpful because I don't have anyone to help me tighten the laces when I'm getting dressed. Another nice feature is that it has a modesty panel behind the laces in a white satin fabric. This will cover any bra, should you wear one, or your back. I plan on wearing this with either a short skirt or jeans when I go dancing. I think it looks flattering and sexy but not overly bare. I'm excited to wear it for the first time!"

These are so inexpensive I thought I'd give them a shot, but you always wonder what kind of selection you'll get. Well, here's what I had:1 orange and white horizontal striped thong with string sides (no label)1 purple thong with wide pinkish lace band and bow (bonprix collection, 60% cotton, 36% polyamide, 4% elastane)1 blue thong with wide lace band (preambule, 90% polyamide, 10% elastane)1 black thong with thin vertical stripes, lace features and pink bow (secret love, nylon/elastane/polyester)1 cheeky white complete lace with wide band (body key, 85% polyester, 15% elastane)1 white complete lace thong with wide band (no company, 90% nylon, 10% elastane)1 black lay-flat thong (not sure the right term - kind of a step up from laser-cut) (secret treasures, 89% nylon, 11% spandex)1 beige lay-flat thong (same as the above)1 heather gray thong with white and pink wide logo band (bjorn borg, 51% modal, 41% cotton, 8% elastane)1 black thong with white and black medium width logo band (bjorn borg, 91% polyamide, 9% elastane)There's only one I probably won't be wearing at all because it's on the small side, which I think 9 out of 10 is a pretty outcome for a blind buy. Glad to see only two bows - I'll probably cut them off as I generally don't like them. Otherwise, some will be more in rotation than others, but that's more personal preference / mood I think. Overall just increasing my options which is what I had in mind. I could see ordering these again when the time comes."

And hey, I did not expect them to be  a high quality - I know how much I paid for them, so let's be realistic here . U would not want to wear them all day long bc of uncovered elastic inside( see video),  but they would be awesome for showing off and looking pretty. One of received has a loose threads on it, but come on, I am not gonna wear them for 5 years strait , so I am ok with that. Before posting this review , I washed them twice ( in a mesh bag, regular setting) - nothing happened , and air dried - I think hot air would damage the fabric. The colors are super cheerful and omg, how bored I am of all grey/black /beige plain cotton  overwhelming the market, so those colorful panties are like a breath of fresh air ! What do u need to know : they made of thin, shiny, rustling polyester, very lightweight, become softer after washing, lightly constructed and stretch very well, have tiny cotton gusset , fit comfortably, sizing is correct ( my hips are 38, ordered size M, fit me well ),  colors are bright. Please be aware of the elastic band mentioned above - it could really irritate, so no prolong walking in this panties. Overall:  for 2.25 a pair I absolutely enjoy this flirty panties and I definitely look pretty and sexy  in them ).  4 stars instead of 5 for that uncovered elastic band."

We all go through that phase of pregnancy where we think we can actually make our regular underwear work until the end. Then somewhere between 20-30 weeks we hit that wall of surrender and realize we need new underwear...NOW! Like yesterday.This is my 4th pregnancy, and I've never found underwear this cute or this comfortable. I started thinking about a design that might actually work well for me and found these online. Then I looked everywhere for this style in stores because I didn't want to buy underwear online that might not work. I couldn't find this style in stores, so I broke down and ordered it online. I'm so glad I took the risk and bought the 5 pack!!!It has a flattering shape under my belly, and doesn't add ANY pressure to my already tight abdomen. I feel sexier in my panties than I've ever felt at this stage of pregnancy.I am 5' 7"". I’m around 130lbs when I'm not pregnant. I generally wear a medium pre-pregnancy and it gives me a little extra room. I'm active, in good shape, and on track to gain ~30lbs with this pregnancy  (which is a healthy amount for me). I listened to reviews and bought the large instead of the medium. I thought they might be too big after they came in, but once I laundered them they fit quite well with a tiny bit of stretch room to carry me through the end of pregnancy.I cannot explain how happy I am with these underwear. I use these 5 underwear in combination with 3 Hanky Panky low-rise thongs (worth every penny!!!), and I've never been more happy with my maternity undergarments. Just wish I'd had them for my last 3 pregnancies.SIDE NOTE: WHY HAS IT TAKEN THE MATERNITY INDUSTRY SO LONG TO FIGURE OUT THIS DESIGN?!!! And where are the jeans like this?! Granted you'd need a long shirt, but seriously, pregnant women have been folding their pants down for decades. When women like a style enough to deal with extra bulk... Someone please catch on!!!Also, I can't get my poor husband's name off of this review. :/"

I am super happy with this purchase! I hope they wash well cause I always wash undies in hot water for sanitary reasons and I always put laundry in the drier at low heat.

Plus, the crotch liner's top seam is very low and cuts right at my inner bits, so they are very irritating to wear.  I can't wear them for more than like 5 minutes (if) without tossing them off and wishing I would not have bought them.  I know lots of ladies that love this blend for their undies, and several brands use this blend, but I can't stand it myself.  I wish it was not so hard to find pure, 100% soft cotton undies.

It does NOT cover my belly, and I just had a c section. It pushes my belly out, but does make my waist look nice.I would prefer something that will go lower on my torso.Fit: I opened it and I was like yeah.... this is NOT going to fit. Don’t me intimidated; put it on. Give it a go. It is true to size as hard as it may be to believe the first time. I’m a 12 -14 post baby and I got the XL.So yes, your waist will look good. You will be able to breathe in it. It’s wearable all day. I didn’t notice any problems in 3 days with my sensitive skin. No sweating (although it is winter).

You should have to lie down and pull on both sides as hard as you can to get it to close.

Just giving a bit of background for anyone looking to purchase this item.I ordered the medium hoping that it would fit. My large waist trainer was becoming very roomy, but I had purchased it from a different seller and was not entirely sure I was ready for the medium.Anyhoo...This one is perfect!I have it on the first set of hooks and it’s very comfortable and will not let you slouch at all. I love the hook/zipper combo. It makes the waist trainer feel more secure. And the over the shoulder straps are adjustable which made the trainer more comfortable. I’m ordering another one today so I always have a clean one ready to go!As far as the sizing goes I will say this much. My family is old school and I have been wearing some kind of cincher or girdle since puberty so my definition of comfort might not be the same as another’s. I feel like this is a perfect medium for someone who is actively waist training. It holds you but still has the flexibility so you can move about normally. I think it fits true to size if you want that extra hold. Waist training is not supposed to feel like nothing. You are supposed to be aware of the garment but never be in pain."

I think the lace details on the tops of the cups of the bra is slightly different but still looks amazing . Love it ! Very sexy and I can’t wait to wear this . I plan to buy the red one as well.

I didnt want to risk them needing to stretch too much because I didn't want them to become see through, so I ordered up a size as other reviewers suggested and  they fit perfectly. They are even squat proof! (I tested it in a bright bathroom, so believe me, as long as you order the right size and they aren't too small and stretched to the max, they are NOT see through!The honeycomb texture of these leggings completely conceals any dimples or cellulite. The waistband is pretty high so any tummy is sucked in, which is critical for me, as I just had a baby 3 months ago. I am been blessed with a pretty good butt, but these give it an extra oomph. I just put them on for the first time and my husband came in and made a point to say how amazing my ""assets "" look!  I was standing in front the mirror in the bathroom, and I even caught him in the reflection continueing to stare lol!My only complaint is that they are pretty long. I am very short  and normally have bunching at the ankles with most leggings,  but I have more bunching than usual with these.Even so its not enough to take away how pleased I am with these leggings. I'll be washing them in the delicate cycle to ensure they don't get ruined, so hopefully they hold up! I'll likely had to get another pair since I like them so much."

I've always had a strong dislike of this type of underware. But now I live in leggings and in the past used laser cut sport hipsters and haven't been completely satisfied. They start perfect until I start sweating and then they start bunching at my hips. So I've been constantly adjusting my pants throughout my workouts.I got fedup and this is what I thought:I purchased a medium instead of my usual small size since I've read that it can squeeze hip fat. I'm a true small so now I've had these a few months, they've stretched a little. Still very comfortable and work great but wanted to try the smalls.The smalls are fantastic! I should have gotten my regular size. But now I just use both and I'm in love. I wear them everyday!I'll still wear my hipsters for hiking and running outside. For the gym, these are my go to. But for how comfy they are I'd wear them everyday regardless of outfit."

Never been the kind of girl that wears thongs. I have always found them to be extremelt uncomfortable.  I stopped wearing thongs years ago when I finally decided that I wasn’t going to torture myself anymore and just decided to wear regular cotton panties.  While the panties are usually wear are very comfortable, I have “panty lines” on my backside when I wear workout clothes, yoga pants, or leggings (which is all I wear).  My boyfriend pointed out the fact that the panty lines were very visible and since then I’ve became self-conscious.  I started to wear long shirts that cover my backside because I didn’t want my panty lines showing...  after doing that for a while I’ve decided that I would consider wearing thongs again to avoid the panty lines and so I came to Amazon and started reading reviews in hopes of finding thongs that are comfortable.  I am 5‘4“ tall and 136 pounds. I wear a size medium, however, the 6 pack that I wanted to buy was not available in a size medium so I ordered a size small. I received them today.  When I first tried one on and I looked in a mirror I was pretty upset. The size small was small on me (I knew I needed a size medium). Anyways, I thought about returning them but was upset because I knew Amazon was out of the medium size and surprisingly, theae were so comfortable that I wanted to keep them. I took the thing and stretched it. I grabbed one end with one hand and the other end with the other hand and stretched it out as far as it would. Then I tried them on again and BAM! They were no longer small around my wasit! They fitted me perfectly!!! So I decided to keep the small size. These are very very comfy. Feels like wearing nothing at all and no panty lines anymore!!!!! I can see myself wearing these everyday :)"

These are THe best things I’ve ever had; and I’ve bought some pretty expensive ones before! I ended up buying a large bec I bought mediums in a diff brand and while they fit for most part, they did create a line at the waist where they dug in-which made me feel self conscious and muffin-toppy and I didn’t want the same w these happening. And while the large did feel slightly big I was afraid that the mediums would cause same problems as others so i never returned them. However, since I’ve lost a little weight and they are already getting too big to wear soon! I’m going to give it a little more time to lose a bit more and then definitely ordering these in mediums!I wear them esp to the gym now. And let me tell you how amazing it is to NOT have to be worried of wedgies, uncomfortable rubs and just unbreathable panties!

Today I received my “normal” size and it actually fits great.Now for why I love this bra - I used to be a hearty C cup for years and years. I could wear a normal non push up bra and have great cleveage, but the last few years I have been dealing with an illness that has taken a lot of toll on my body. I lost 30+ lbs. and have a hard time maintaining any weight gain. Sooo my lush Cs turned into tiny tiny As. None of my cute lingerie fit anymore and I’ve worn bralettes as a replacement, that means NO cleveage. ZERO. I figured finding cute bras to give me any push up was a waste of time because what is there to push up??? Till I found this bra, there was a heart sinking moment when I couldn’t remotely fill the cups of the 34A but the smaller size has answered my prayers! 32A and all the way cinched up I have actual cleveage!!! I can’t believe it! I forgot what that feels like.Now bralettes are way more comfortable no doubt but this is PERFECT for date nights or whenever I want a little boost.Now your tits are certainly not the end all be all of your self worth and that needs to be said. But the ability to transform yourself is one I hold in the highest regard and this bra is an amazing tool for that. This opens me up that there are cute push ups for A cups and I will probably get another one!"

I didn't think that these would be anything but a pair of extremely high-waisted underwear but they actually did bring my tummy in enough that I could confidently wear a bodycon dress (which is a HUGE deal for me). I ordered them a size smaller than what I would normally wear as far as panties go, and I do think that that's what did the trick. The only problem I ran into with that was that the non-stretchy lace part was kind of tight and abrasive in the groin area. Otherwise, there was no muffin top and they never once rolled down at the top in all the times that I wore them. I've lost weight since I ordered these so I definitely plan to order another pair soon!"

I thought the 5x would be a tad too small if not spot on, based off the reviews and size chart. But they are pretty big on me. The lace around the butt part just kind of hangs off me and doesn’t look good at all. The tag appears to be ripped out of them as well. Not sure if it was a manufacturing mistake or if they were returned after they were worn. I did the old try on over your current panties trick (like with swimsuits). And they were still really loose on me. My butt is sort of flat from having hip problems during my last pregnancy which ended 2 months ago. And the top of the underwear run right along my c-section scar.. so my belly kind of hangs over them.. ick. But if you’ve got a bubble butt and no belly overhang, This might look good on you. Just didn’t work for my post partum body."

So I really appreciate when companies tell you what their sizes actually mean, instead of you having to guess what size you may be.With that being said, I am usually a size 20 in jeans and picked 5x and I should have picked the 4x because these were big on me.These are also more like buttless panties as they cover your front 'area'. But I asked my boyfriend... after 😉 what he thought of them, and if he liked my other sexy panties I have more, less, or the same as these?His reply: ""Well I didn't have to take these off, which I like, so more"" (He's not a big talker)So to recap if you close or in between sizes definitely go down, and just know that they are more buttless than crochless, but my boyfriend followed me after just seeing a peek, so they are a 5 in book. 😉"
